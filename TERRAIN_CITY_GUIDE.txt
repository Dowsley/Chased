                    TERRAIN-ADAPTIVE CITY BUILDER
================================================================================

WHAT'S NEW?
-----------

Your city builder now has TERRAIN DETECTION! It will:

✓ Auto-detect your terrain size
✓ Fill the entire terrain with city blocks
✓ Adjust to terrain changes automatically
✓ Generate roads on the grid
✓ Adapt when you resize your terrain


HOW IT WORKS:
-------------

The TerrainCityBuilder script:

1. FINDS your terrain in the scene
2. MEASURES its dimensions (width x length)
3. CALCULATES how many city blocks fit
4. GENERATES buildings, roads, and props to fill it
5. POSITIONS everything perfectly on the terrain


QUICK START (3 STEPS):
----------------------

1. Open Unity Menu → Chased → Quick City Setup

2. The settings are now terrain-aware:
   • Auto-Detect Terrain: ON (finds terrain automatically)
   • Terrain Coverage: 90% (how much of terrain to fill)
   • Block Size: 40m (building block dimensions)
   • Street Width: 12m (road width for chasing)

3. Click "BUILD COMPLETE CHASE CITY"

That's it! The city fills your terrain automatically.


WHAT HAPPENS:
-------------

When you click "Build City", the script:

1. Searches for Terrain in your scene
2. Reads terrain size (e.g., 1000x1000)
3. Calculates grid: (1000 * 0.9) / (40 + 12) = ~17 blocks
4. Creates 17x17 city grid
5. Places buildings in blocks
6. Generates road network between blocks
7. Adds street props (barriers, signals)


EXAMPLE:
--------

Your terrain: 1000m x 1000m
Block size: 40m
Street width: 12m
Coverage: 90%

Result:
- Usable area: 900m x 900m
- Cell size: 40 + 12 = 52m
- Blocks: 900 / 52 = ~17 blocks per side
- Total: 17x17 = 289 city blocks!
- 18x18 = 324 roads connecting them


ADJUSTING TO YOUR TERRAIN:
---------------------------

Change terrain size? Just rebuild:

SMALL TERRAIN (500x500):
→ ~9x9 city blocks (smaller city for tight chases)

MEDIUM TERRAIN (1000x1000):
→ ~17x17 city blocks (balanced gameplay)

LARGE TERRAIN (2000x2000):
→ ~34x34 city blocks (huge city for long chases)


CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
----------------------

TERRAIN COVERAGE (0.5 - 1.0):
- 0.5 = Uses 50% of terrain (city in center, open edges)
- 0.9 = Uses 90% of terrain (fills almost entirely)
- 1.0 = Uses 100% of terrain (edge-to-edge city)

BLOCK SIZE (20-80m):
- 20m = Small blocks, dense city, many buildings
- 40m = Medium blocks, balanced (recommended)
- 80m = Large blocks, spacious city, fewer buildings

STREET WIDTH (8-20m):
- 8m = Narrow streets, tight racing
- 12m = Perfect for chase gameplay (recommended)
- 20m = Wide boulevards, easy maneuvering


ROADS:
------

The system creates roads TWO ways:

METHOD 1: Simple Road Planes (always works)
- Creates cube primitives scaled into roads
- Gray material
- Has colliders for driving
- Works immediately

METHOD 2: EasyRoads3D Integration (if available)
- Tries to use EasyRoads3D Road Network
- Creates proper road objects
- Better visuals
- Falls back to Method 1 if not available


BUILDING PLACEMENT:
-------------------

Buildings are placed intelligently:

• DOWNTOWN (city center): More skyscrapers
• OUTSKIRTS (edges): More regular buildings
• RANDOM DENSITY: Some blocks have 1-3 buildings
• RANDOM ROTATION: 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°
• TERRAIN HEIGHT: Buildings sit on terrain properly


VEHICLE SPAWNING:
-----------------

With TerrainCityBuilder, vehicles spawn:

• PLAYER: At terrain city center
• COPS: On random streets around player
• HEIGHT: Above terrain surface (+1m)
• POSITIONS: On actual road positions

Perfect for immediate chase action!


COMPARING OLD vs NEW:
---------------------

OLD CityBuilder:
- Fixed size (8x8, 10x10, etc.)
- Manual configuration
- Doesn't adapt to terrain
- Ground plane only

NEW TerrainCityBuilder:
- Auto-sizes to terrain
- Detects terrain changes
- Samples terrain height
- Generates roads
- Adapts to any size


USING BOTH:
-----------

You can use BOTH builders:

TerrainCityBuilder:
→ For terrain-based scenes
→ Auto-adapts to terrain size
→ Best for large open worlds

CityBuilder (original):
→ For fixed-size cities
→ When you don't have terrain
→ For controlled city layouts


MANUAL SETUP:
-------------

If you want manual control:

1. Create Empty GameObject
2. Add Component → TerrainCityBuilder
3. Configure settings:
   - Auto Detect Terrain: ON
   - Terrain Coverage: 0.9
   - Block Size: 40
   - Street Width: 12
   - Generate Roads: ON

4. Click buttons in Inspector:
   - "Load Building Prefabs"
   - "Load Skyscraper Prefabs"
   - "Load Street Props"

5. Click "BUILD TERRAIN CITY"

Done!


TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
----------------------

CHASE GAMEPLAY:
- Street Width: 12m (tight but manageable)
- Block Size: 40m (good for maneuvering)
- Terrain Coverage: 0.9 (leaves some edge space)

OPEN WORLD EXPLORATION:
- Street Width: 16m (comfortable driving)
- Block Size: 60m (more spacious)
- Terrain Coverage: 0.8 (natural edges)

DENSE URBAN:
- Street Width: 8m (cramped streets)
- Block Size: 25m (tight blocks)
- Terrain Coverage: 1.0 (wall-to-wall city)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Q: City is too small/big?
A: Adjust Block Size and Street Width
   Smaller values = more blocks fit
   Larger values = fewer blocks fit

Q: City doesn't fill terrain?
A: Increase Terrain Coverage (try 0.95 or 1.0)

Q: No roads appear?
A: Roads are created as simple planes
   Check "GeneratedRoads" GameObject
   They're gray cubes scaled thin

Q: Buildings floating/underground?
A: The system samples terrain height
   Check your terrain isn't too steep

Q: Want to change after building?
A: Just click "Build City" again!
   It clears the old city first


COMBINING WITH EASYROADS3D:
---------------------------

You have EasyRoads3D! After building:

1. City creates basic road grid
2. You can add custom roads:
   - Open EasyRoads3D toolbar
   - Add curved roads between blocks
   - Create highway overpasses
   - Add ramps and tunnels

3. The grid provides structure
   Your custom roads add variety!


PERFORMANCE:
------------

Terrain detection is fast:
- Finds terrain: <1ms
- Calculates grid: <1ms
- Builds city: 1-5 seconds (depends on size)

For huge terrains (4000x4000+):
- Reduce Block Size → fewer blocks
- Or increase Block Size → bigger blocks, less buildings


TERRAIN CHANGES:
----------------

Changed your terrain? No problem!

1. Resize terrain in Unity
2. Open Chased → Quick City Setup
3. Click "Build City Only"

The city rebuilds to fit the new size!


EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
------------------

SCENARIO 1: Import new terrain
→ System detects it automatically
→ Builds city to fit
→ Roads connect everything

SCENARIO 2: Terrain too small
→ System calculates: 5x5 blocks fit
→ Creates compact city
→ Perfect for quick chases

SCENARIO 3: Massive terrain
→ System calculates: 50x50 blocks fit
→ Creates huge city
→ Epic long-distance pursuits

SCENARIO 4: No terrain
→ System logs warning
→ Creates 8x8 city at origin
→ Works anyway!


NEXT LEVEL:
-----------

Want more control?

Edit TerrainCityBuilder.cs to:
- Add building height variation
- Create districts (residential, commercial, industrial)
- Add terrain-based building placement (avoid steep slopes)
- Create parks in certain blocks
- Add elevation-based skyscraper placement
