                    CHASED - HOW TO PLAY
================================================================================

QUICK START - GET PLAYING IN 3 STEPS!
================================================================================

STEP 1: BUILD YOUR CITY
------------------------
1. Open Unity
2. In the top menu, go to: Chased > Quick City Setup
3. A window will appear with settings
4. Click the big green button: "BUILD COMPLETE CHASE CITY"
5. Wait a few seconds while the city generates

That's it! The city automatically fits your terrain size and generates
roads, buildings, and spawns vehicles.

NOTE: The city now auto-detects your terrain and fills it completely!
If your terrain changes size, just rebuild and it adapts.


STEP 2: OPEN THE SCENE
-----------------------
1. In the Project panel (bottom), navigate to: Assets/Scenes
2. Double-click "chased.unity" to open it
3. You should see your city in the Scene view


STEP 3: PRESS PLAY!
--------------------
1. Look at the top-center of Unity
2. Click the ► (Play) button
3. The game starts!


================================================================================
GAME CONTROLS
================================================================================

DRIVING THE CAR:
----------------
W or Up Arrow    = Accelerate
S or Down Arrow  = Brake / Reverse
A or Left Arrow  = Steer Left
D or Right Arrow = Steer Right
Space            = Brake/Handbrake

GAMEPAD (if you have a controller):
Gamepad Left Stick = Steering and Acceleration

(Based on your Unity Input System setup)


CAMERA:
-------
The camera follows your car automatically
- Dynamic FOV changes with speed
- Camera rolls during turns for cinematic feel


OBJECTIVE:
----------
You're being chased by cop cars! Try to:
- Escape the cops
- Don't let them catch you
- Use the city streets to your advantage
- Cut through intersections
- Use tight turns to lose them


================================================================================
WHAT YOU'LL SEE
================================================================================

When you press Play, you'll see:

✓ Your car (the player car) in the center of the city
✓ 6 cop cars positioned around you (with flashing lights)
✓ A grid-based city with:
  - NY-style buildings
  - Wide streets
  - Intersections
  - Props and obstacles

The cop cars will immediately start chasing you!


================================================================================
TIPS FOR BETTER GAMEPLAY
================================================================================

1. USE INTERSECTIONS:
   - Cop cars chase directly toward you
   - Quick turns at intersections can shake them off

2. WATCH YOUR SPEED:
   - Too fast = hard to turn
   - Too slow = cops catch up
   - Find the balance!

3. USE THE CAMERA:
   - The camera shows what's behind you
   - Keep an eye on pursuing cops

4. PLAN YOUR ROUTE:
   - The city is a grid
   - Multiple paths to anywhere
   - Don't get cornered!

5. BUILDINGS ARE SOLID:
   - You can crash into them
   - Use them to block cop cars
   - But don't crash yourself!


================================================================================
ADJUSTING THE GAME
================================================================================

Want to change things? You can adjust:

NUMBER OF COPS:
1. Before building the city, change "Number of Cop Cars" in Quick City Setup
2. Can set from 2 to 12 cops

CITY SIZE:
1. In Quick City Setup, adjust "City Size"
2. Bigger city = more space to escape
3. Smaller city = more intense chase

COP DIFFICULTY:
1. In the Scene view, select any "CopCar" GameObject
2. In Inspector, find the "AIDriverInput" component
3. Adjust:
   - Pursuit Speed: How fast cops chase (1.3 = 130% of your speed)
   - Aggressiveness: How hard they ram (0.7 = somewhat aggressive)
   - Slow Down Distance: When they slow near you (10 units)


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Nothing happens when I press Play
SOLUTION:
- Make sure you built the city first (Step 1)
- Check that you have the "chased" scene open
- Look in the Hierarchy panel - you should see "PlayerCar" and "CopCar" objects

PROBLEM: I can't control the car
SOLUTION:
- Check that "PlayerCar" exists in the scene
- Make sure the car has a "PlayerDriverInput" component
- Open Edit > Project Settings > Input System to verify controls

PROBLEM: Cops don't chase me
SOLUTION:
- Check GameManager exists in scene
- Select a CopCar, verify "AIDriverInput" component exists
- Check "disabled" is NOT checked in AIDriverInput

PROBLEM: Car falls through the ground
SOLUTION:
- The ground should have a collider
- Check Physics collision matrix (Edit > Project Settings > Physics)
- Make sure layers are set to collide

PROBLEM: Everything is too dark
SOLUTION:
- Add a Directional Light to the scene
- GameObject > Light > Directional Light
- Adjust the rotation to point downward

PROBLEM: City is empty (no buildings)
SOLUTION:
- In Quick City Setup, click the individual buttons first:
  - "Load Building Prefabs from NY Folder"
  - "Load Skyscraper Prefabs"
- Then click "Build City Only"


================================================================================
RESTARTING THE GAME
================================================================================

While Playing:
- Click the ► button again to stop the game
- Click it once more to play again

To Rebuild the City:
- Stop the game first
- Open: Chased > Quick City Setup
- Click "BUILD COMPLETE CHASE CITY" again
- This replaces the old city with a new layout


================================================================================
ADVANCED: USING THE SCENE SCRIPTS DIRECTLY
================================================================================

If you want more control, you can use the components directly:

1. CREATE CITY BUILDER:
   - Create Empty GameObject
   - Add Component > CityBuilder
   - Click "Load Building Prefabs from NY Folder"
   - Click "Build City"
   - Adjust settings in Inspector

2. CREATE SCENE SETUP:
   - Create Empty GameObject
   - Add Component > ChaseSceneSetup
   - Click "Auto-Load Prefabs"
   - Drag CityBuilder to "City Builder" field
   - Click "Setup Chase Scene"

This gives you fine-grained control over:
- Block size
- Street width
- Building density
- Spawn positions
- And more!


================================================================================
