                    CHASED - CITY BUILDER GUIDE
================================================================================

Your chase game now has procedural city building tools! Here's how to use them:

================================================================================
QUICK START
================================================================================

1. Open Unity and load your "chased" scene (Assets/Scenes/chased.unity)

2. Create an empty GameObject in the scene:
   - Right-click in Hierarchy > Create Empty
   - Name it "CityBuilder"

3. Add the CityBuilder script:
   - Select the CityBuilder GameObject
   - In Inspector, click "Add Component"
   - Search for "CityBuilder" and add it

4. In the CityBuilder Inspector, click these buttons:
   - "Load Building Prefabs from NY Folder"
   - "Load Skyscraper Prefabs"
   - "Load Street Props" (optional)

5. Adjust settings if desired:
   - City Width: 8 (number of blocks wide)
   - City Length: 8 (number of blocks long)
   - Block Size: 40 (size of each building block)
   - Street Width: 12 (width of streets - perfect for chase gameplay)

6. Click "BUILD CITY" button
   - This creates a procedural city grid!
   - Buildings will be placed automatically
   - Streets will be created between blocks

================================================================================
SETTING UP VEHICLES
================================================================================

1. Create another empty GameObject:
   - Name it "SceneSetup"

2. Add the ChaseSceneSetup script:
   - Select the SceneSetup GameObject
   - Add Component > ChaseSceneSetup

3. Click "Auto-Load Prefabs" button
   - This loads your PlayerCar and AICar prefabs automatically

4. Configure chase settings:
   - Number of Cop Cars: 6 (or however many you want)
   - Spawn Radius: 80 (distance from player)

5. Link the CityBuilder:
   - Drag the CityBuilder GameObject to the "City Builder" field

6. Click "SETUP CHASE SCENE" button
   - Player car spawns in city center
   - Cop cars spawn around the player
   - Camera is configured automatically

================================================================================
CITY LAYOUT FEATURES
================================================================================

The city is designed specifically for chase gameplay:

✓ GRID LAYOUT: Manhattan-style grid perfect for pursuits
✓ WIDE STREETS: 12-unit wide streets for maneuvering
✓ INTERSECTIONS: Multiple crossing points for tactical gameplay
✓ BUILDING VARIETY: Mix of NY buildings and skyscrapers
✓ DOWNTOWN AREA: Taller buildings in the center
✓ STREET PROPS: Barriers and signals for obstacles
✓ COLLIDERS: All buildings have collision for realistic crashes

================================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION TIPS
================================================================================

Want to modify the city? Here are some ideas:

DENSE CITY:
- Increase City Width and Length (e.g., 12x12)
- Decrease Block Size (e.g., 30)
- More buildings, tighter streets

OPEN CITY:
- Increase Block Size (e.g., 60)
- Increase Street Width (e.g., 20)
- More space for high-speed chases

ADD VARIETY:
- Mix building types (NY, Houses, Warehouses)
- Add more props along streets
- Create themed districts

PERFORMANCE:
- Smaller grid for better FPS (6x6)
- Fewer street props
- Use LOD groups on buildings

================================================================================
USING WITH EASYROADS3D
================================================================================

Your project has EasyRoads3D for creating custom road networks:

1. After building the city, you can add custom roads:
   - Window > EasyRoads3D > Road Network
   - Create roads that connect through your city
   - Perfect for highways, ramps, etc.

2. Roads can go:
   - Between buildings
   - Over buildings (elevated highways)
   - Underground (tunnels)

3. The procedural city provides the buildings, EasyRoads3D adds roads!

================================================================================
CHASE GAMEPLAY TIPS
================================================================================

The city layout supports these chase mechanics:

• INTERSECTIONS: Create decision points - turn or go straight?
• ALLEYS: Narrow passages between buildings for risky shortcuts
• OPEN STREETS: Main avenues for high-speed pursuit
• BUILDING BLOCKS: Line of sight blockers - lose the cops!
• PROPS: Barriers and obstacles to dodge
• MULTIPLE PATHS: Grid allows many routes to any destination

================================================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

The scripts work directly with Unity's text-based scene format:
- All changes are saved in the scene file
- City is built as GameObjects (not procedural meshes)
- Each building is a prefab instance
- Fully compatible with Unity's lighting and navmesh

The city persists when you save the scene. To rebuild:
- Click "Build City" again (clears old city first)
- Or manually delete the "City" GameObject

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Q: Buildings don't show up?
A: Make sure you clicked "Load Building Prefabs" first!

Q: No collisions with buildings?
A: The script auto-adds colliders. Check building prefabs have MeshFilters.

Q: Cars fall through ground?
A: The ground plane has a collider. Check Layer Collision Matrix.

Q: City is too big/small?
A: Adjust City Width, Length, and Block Size in CityBuilder settings.

Q: Want to change after building?
A: Just click "Build City" again with new settings!

================================================================================
READY TO CHASE!
================================================================================

You now have a procedural city perfect for cat-and-mouse chase gameplay!

1. Build the city
2. Setup the chase scene
3. Press Play
4. Get chased!

Have fun and good luck outrunning those cop cars!
