================================================================================
RECOMMENDED SETUP FOR YOUR CHASE GAME
================================================================================

USE: Mixed Urban (Variant B)

WHY:
───
✓ Dense enough for urban chase feel
✓ 81 unique buildings = NO REPETITION in view
✓ Three district types = visual variety
✓ All optimized low-poly (good performance)
✓ Modern + classic mix = interesting environment

CONFIGURATION:
──────────────
In TerrainCityBuilder.cs, use:

Building Prefabs (buildingPrefabs):
  → Load: NY Buildings (33 prefabs)
  → Load: Phaneron_LP (16 prefabs)
  → Total: 49 mid-rise buildings

Skyscraper Prefabs (skyscraperPrefabs):
  → Load: Skyscrapers (32 prefabs)

Street Props (streetProps):
  → Load: Props folder (13 props)

RESULT:
• Downtown core = Skyscrapers (32 types)
• Outer blocks = NY + Phaneron (49 types)
• Streets = Traffic lights, barriers, signals
• TOTAL VARIETY = 81 building types!


================================================================================
ASSET FEATURES YOU HAVE
================================================================================

GLOSS & EMISSION MAPS:
──────────────────────
Your buildings have:
✓ Reflective windows (gloss maps)
✓ Lit windows at night (emission maps)

This means:
→ Day: Buildings have realistic window reflections
→ Night: Windows glow (looks amazing in chase!)

LOW POLY OPTIMIZATION:
──────────────────────
✓ Optimized for mobile/low-end hardware
✓ Great performance even with many buildings
✓ Perfect for chase game (needs good framerate)

TEXTURE VARIETY:
────────────────
You have texture sets for:
✓ NYC style
✓ Barcelona style
✓ France style
✓ Venice style
✓ Mexico style
✓ Croatia style
✓ Warehouse industrial
✓ Modern Phaneron
✓ Houses
✓ Skyscrapers

Each style has unique materials and colors!


================================================================================
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING (Optional Enhancements)
================================================================================

For a complete city, you might want to ADD later:

GROUND/ROADS:
□ Road texture (asphalt with lines) - You have basic, could upgrade
□ Sidewalk textures with curbs
□ Crosswalk decals

ADDITIONAL PROPS:
□ Parked cars (static props) - Would add life
□ Trees/vegetation - For parks or street trees
□ Benches, bus stops
□ Trash cans, mailboxes
□ Fire hydrants (different from barriers)

SPECIAL LANDMARKS:
□ Gas station
□ Bank (distinctive building)
□ Police station (ironic for chase game!)
□ Fire station

DECORATIVE:
□ Billboards
□ Awnings/canopies
□ Store signs

BUT: These are NOT necessary for a dense urban city!
     Your current assets are MORE than sufficient.


================================================================================
COMPARISON TO WHAT YOU NEED
================================================================================

MINIMUM for dense urban city:  20-30 building types
GOOD for dense urban city:     40-60 building types
EXCELLENT for dense city:      60-80 building types

YOU HAVE:                      81 URBAN building types! ⭐

VERDICT: You have EXCELLENT asset coverage!


================================================================================
EXAMPLE USAGE IN YOUR CITY BUILDER
================================================================================

Current Setup (what you've been using):
────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Building Prefabs: NY folder (33 buildings)
✓ Skyscraper Prefabs: Skyscrapers folder (32 buildings)
✓ Street Props: Props folder (13 props)

TOTAL USED: 65 buildings + 13 props = 78 assets

This is already GREAT! But you have MORE available!


Expanded Setup (to use even more variety):
───────────────────────────────────────────
Building Prefabs:
  • NY folder (33)
  • Phaneron_LP folder (16)
  • Barcelona folder (19)
  TOTAL: 68 building variations

Skyscraper Prefabs:
  • Skyscrapers folder (32)

Street Props:
  • Props folder (13)

TOTAL: 100 buildings + 13 props = 113 unique assets!


Maximum Setup (everything):
────────────────────────────
Load ALL building folders = 204 buildings!
BUT: Might be overkill, and houses don't fit urban theme


================================================================================

FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

Q: Do you have enough for a dense urban city?

A: YES! You have 4X MORE than needed! ✅✅✅

BREAKDOWN:
──────────
